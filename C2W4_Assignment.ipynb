        "Welcome to the final assignment of this course! For this week, you will implement a distribution strategy to train on the [Oxford Flowers 102](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/oxford_flowers102) dataset. As the name suggests, distribution strategies allow you to setup training across multiple devices. We are just using a single device in this lab but the syntax you'll apply should also work when you have a multi-device setup. Let's begin!"

You can do `tf.distribute.Strategy.reduce` to get an aggregated value. You can also do `tf.distribute.Strategy.experimental_local_results` to get the list of values contained in the result, one per local replica.\n"
